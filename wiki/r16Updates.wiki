= Updating to r16 or higher - READ THIS FIRST =
If you are updating to r16 or higher from previous versions, please note that you will need to *update your cron.py files*

you will need to change your old imports:
{{{
    from django_cron import cron
}}}

to

{{{
    from django_cron import cronScheduler as cron
}}}

This change was to resolve an ugly namespace problem
